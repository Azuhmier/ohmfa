A quick note, I'm not very fast at writing. I've been on and off for months, and I'm sorry. I've been getting my shit together over the past few weeks, but life still hits hard on occasion. Anyways, here's what you're looking for.

Quick explanation for the old version of Baseline being, y'know, incomplete: I did all of it on my phone, and while moving everything to one file, shit went sideways and I lost the first five chapters. There goes character development and introductions. Rip.


Ye olde shit is here, before I started really getting into the whole writing thing.

**| Baseline |** A guy downloads an app and goes places. Some NSFW in here.

Rewritten shit goes here. I'm taking this seriously.

**| Baseline Rewrite |** Same guy from the last thing, except he's going down a different road. Paired with a sapient phone application and a grocer employee, adventures will be had. Predominately safe for work right about now.
